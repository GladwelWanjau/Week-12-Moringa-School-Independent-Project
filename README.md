# Week-12-Moringa-School-Independent-Project
This is my project for the Week 12 Datascience journey at Moringa School.During the week we had cover the introduction to R and we were supposed to apply this knowledge to solve the following quesion ''A Kenyan entrepreneur has created an online cryptography course and would want to advertise it on her blog. She currently targets audiences originating from various countries. In the past, she ran ads to advertise a related course on the same blog and collected data in the process. She would now like to employ your services as a Data Science Consultant to help her identify which individuals are most likely to click on her ads."
I therefore went ahead to discover that the most likely individuals would be: From a low income area,would be of a high age,would not spend a lot of time online and their daily internet Usage would be low.
